In on this page I want to reference my previous post, among other things... The old links are below, but the new link I want to post is my [previous post][pp]. Hopefully this works.

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll’s dedicated Help repository][jekyll-help].
